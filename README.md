## Introduction
    
TraceLog is a runtime configurable Objective-C debug logging system.  It allows flexible configuration via environment variables at run time which allows each developer to configure log output per session based on the debugging needs of that session.

## Installation

TraceLog is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "TraceLog"
```

See the ["Using CocoaPods"](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) guide for more information.
